#### Gender Breakdown
Based on the visualization we can see that Males, colored in orange, are the majority users with just over 1.5 million. Women, in blue, on the other hand rank in with about a million less than their counterparts at 588,431. The rest of the pie chart represents unknown gender with the color red at just about a quarter million.

## Summary
### Findings

### Suggestions
To aid in solidifying the proposal to potential stakeholders I would recommend creating a visualization with a breakdown of the age of users based on the ‘birth year’ data point given in the csv file. We could create 10-year ranges to figure out who the main audience is that is utilizing this service and then find ways to target advertisements toward them specifically to hopefully grow our numbers and entice new clients. 

Another potential visualization we could create to bolster the pitch would be to calculate the average distance between bike stations to determine if they are too far apart and if we need to implement more or if we have to many and can reduce the number to save money or if it’s just the right amount.
